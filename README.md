# Welcome!

This repository contains mainly code I worked on during my time at grad school.

### CassandraAnalysisLibrary
Analysis Toolkit for CASSANDRA, an open source Monte Carlo code developed at the University of Notre Dame. For more information on CASSANDRA, please visit https://cassandra.nd.edu/

Update 1/8/2018: Code now supports Python Egg installation.

### MISCELLANEOUS 
Basic LJ Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics scripts. Code is not optimized at all and was written at a time I was first learning Python. You have been forewarned!
