# Codes

Miscellanious codes written in Python during my time at grad school.

Contains dir:

CassandraAnalysisLibrary - Analysis Toolkit for CASSANDRA, an open source Monte Carlo code developed at the University of Notre Dame. For more information on CASSANDRA, please visit https://cassandra.nd.edu/

MISCELLANEOUS - Basic LJ Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics scripts. Code is not optimized at all and was written at a time I was first learning Python. (You have been forewarned!)
